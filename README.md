# Virtual-Hosts-Chrome-Extension
Overwrite the virtual host HTTP header in Chrome requests to debug your web server or work around DNS restrictions.

This extension is available in the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/virtual-hosts/aiehidpclglccialeifedhajckcpedom

I've received a couple of requests to implement some more features, unfortunately I simply don't have the time. Therefore I release this project so if there are any features you're missing, you are now able to implement them :)

Please do not monetize on this code, keep it open and free.
Fork and pull if you'd like to see your feature in the Web Store version!
